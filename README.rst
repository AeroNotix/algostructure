Algostructures
==============

This repository is a collection of various algorithms and datastructures in a host
of languages. The reasoning behind this repo was at first for me to learn the tools
at hand. As well as being able to compare implementations in the different languages.

Since then it has grown to where I would like it to be a complete collection of
idiomatic examples of the algorithms used.

In the places where it matters, there are supplied Makefiles. The Makefiles currently
are of poor quality. They don't only assume Linux, they assume ArchLinux. Pull requests
welcome.

Overall, the implementations may not be totally efficient, the idea is that they
show off some of the target languages best features.
